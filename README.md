**Practice - Java Programming for beginners**

*Started April 21, 2020*

I'm currently following a [Java programming course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-programming-tutorial-for-beginners/),
given by [in 28 minutes](https://www.udemy.com/user/in28minutes/). Loving it so far!

This repo contains some of the exercices I completed during the course.
